# Python
so like
this is where i make stuff that isn't LuxOS
but i'm still interested in doing
"Birthday Paradox" was made because a VSauce2 video peaked my interest
"Encryption (Somehow)" was made because i had the random urge to encrypt something but without RSA or SHA-256
"FLHLang" was made because i was fascinated with compilers and wanted to make one
but unfortunately i'm dumb and can't make compilers
so i decided to make an interpreted language instead
